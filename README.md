This is a warm-up project in OOP lecture of my Python Udemy Course.
Implement the card game war. Rules are:

1. Deal out deck of 52 cards between two users.
2. Each player plays a card. Higher card wins. Winner takes both cards.
3. If players tie, then each player puts down 5 cards, and the fifth
   card competes.
   If a player has less than 5 cards, then they put down all of their cards
   and their final card competes against the other player's fifth card.
   Continue doing this until tie is broken.
   Winner takes all cards.
4. Game is over when a player doesn't have any cards. The player with
   cards remaining is the winner.
